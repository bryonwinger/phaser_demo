phaser_demo
===========

This is a simple project used for learning more about the Phaser framework.

Currently, the bulk of the code was adapted from the tutorial found at http://www.photonstorm.com/phaser/tutorial-making-your-first-phaser-game.

Next steps:
 - Add better 'following' logic to the baddies
 - Baddies shouldn't overlap (collision detection)
 - Baddies can jump :)
 - Baddies kill player
 - More randomness to the level
 - Timer
 - Lives
 - Side scrolling world
 - Title screen
 - Game over screen
 - Powerups ?

I'd also eventually like to figure out how to implement class like functionality ala Prototype
