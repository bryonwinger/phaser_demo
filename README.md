phaser_demo
===========

This is a simple project used for learning more about the Phaser framework.

Currently, the bulk of the code was adapted from the tutorial found at http://www.photonstorm.com/phaser/tutorial-making-your-first-phaser-game.

Next steps:
 - Add better 'following' logic to the baddies
 - Baddies shouldn't overlap (collision detection)
 - More randomness to the level
 - Side scrolling world
 - Title screen
 - Game over screen
 - Powerups ?
 - Use Tiled for creating levels
 - Use different art for the game
 - Audio

I'd also eventually like to figure out how to implement class-like functionality ala Prototype

Getting Started
===============

To see it in action, you'll need to fire up a local web server (Apache or other like-minded friends) and grant access to the root directory of the repository. Point your browser to index.html and you should be all set.
